              <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/20wi/projects/stude/"><b>stud-e</b></a> is a personalized study assistant that records and analyzes student productivity information from previous
              study sessions and learns from that data to help users optimize study time and promote good study habits.<br><br>
              Completed in CSE 440 (Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction) in a group of four. Through the duration of this project,
              our team implemented the <i>iterative design process</i> to try and find a way to optimize study time, given this age of
              personal technology and the distractions that come with it. We participated in design research (user interviews), task design,
              storyboarding, paper prototyping, and digital prototyping. <br><br>
