        <p style="line-height:35px; font-size:20px;">Coming into UW, I had a passion for understanding social justice issues. I didn't really know how I'd be able to take that passion and incorporate it into
          my CSE coursework somehow. Until in January 2019, I joined ACM-W as an associate officer. Before this point, I knew that ACM-W was an Allen School student group
          that support womxn in tech. They held many events that I went to, like the Grace Hopper Conference Reflection and their Impostor Syndrome panel. Those were events
          that really stuck with me during the first half of my freshman year and thought that getting involved with this group would be a great way to spend time outside
          the classroom. Along with one other associate officer, I was responsible for aiding executive officers in completing club-related tasks, documenting club
          events and sharing them on the UW ACM-W blog, and I co-organized the ACM-W end of the year community social event,
        <i>Cosmic Bowling with ACM-W</i>!</p>

        <p style="line-height:35px; font-size:20px;">Getting involved in ACM-W as an associate officer introduced me to what leadership looked like in the Allen School. I got to meet so many of the Allen School
        community members and got to experience how unique we all are. Being in ACM-W, I got to interact with people not only in my year, but upperclassmen and faculty as well.
        All of the people I got to meet and all the opportunities I received from my first year in ACM-W inspired me to run for Vice Chair of the organization for my sophomore year.
